This is a placeholder text file that should be replaced with an actual JPG image.
The image should be approximately 1200x630 pixels in size for optimal display.
This file will be used as a fallback when a blog post's cover image is missing.

Note: In a production environment, you should place a real JPG image at this location.
The system has been configured to handle missing images gracefully, but for best appearance,
replace this text file with an actual image.
